adptaing the exploit for ssrf: https://github.com/synacktiv/php_filter_chains_oracle_exploit

you can leak files. The file i want to read is the ~/.google_authenticator which i assume exist by googling the prompt for ssh.
but it seems i cant read inside home folder.

but reading the books on the webapp, is shows an insecure copy to /backup/backup_home so i try to read it from there and it works
