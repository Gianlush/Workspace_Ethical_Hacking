reading the invite.js we find out the endpoint /api/v1/invite/how/to/generate which give the response:

{"0":200,"success":1,"data":{"data":"Va beqre gb trarengr gur vaivgr pbqr, znxr n CBFG erdhrfg gb \/ncv\/i1\/vaivgr\/trarengr","enctype":"ROT13"},"hint":"Data is encrypted ... We should probbably check the encryption type in order to decrypt it..."}

decrypting with ROT13 we see:

/api/v1/invite/generate:

"code":"WEsxN00tVVVUS1ktTlNNSDItQ1Y5UVg=",
frombase64: XK17M-UUTKY-NSMH2-CV9QX

so we can finally login:

with the new cookie, we can access endpoint /api/v1 and see that there are more endpoin, like admin/USk6hm0C5HZ4nnpM6AfzwqOX4lc2dmVAXljavte80s7sLl3GUFtunMxERwKBgQCC
trying to use it, it gives error about missing parameters, so i add them until i see is_admin which i put as 1 so i become admin

if i then check auth i actually am admin

so now i try using some endpoint that were prohibited before, like vpn/generate
and i noticed i can inject code in there. so i did a reverse shell


inside .env file:

DB_DATABASE=htb_prod
DB_USERNAME=admin
DB_PASSWORD=SuperDuperPass123

reused for ssh
