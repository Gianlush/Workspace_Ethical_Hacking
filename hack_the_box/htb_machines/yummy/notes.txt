lfi vuln, with that you leak all the source code and also the jwt logic, which is vulnerable because it leaves exposed the N and E value so you create a jwt for the role administrator and sql inject there.

you can write into file so you overwrite the script in cronjob and wait for rev shell


after getting rev shell you are mysql user, but in the script dir you have write privilege and we know from crontab that app_backup.sh is executed by www-data, so we can delete the script and a new one in order to escalte to www-data

after that you can go into app-qatesting and find and hidden folder .hg

doing ls -al */* to see every file you can see a py.i so we see strings in it

#md5
9    'user': 'chef',
    'password': '3wDo7gSRZIwIHRxZ!',
'user': 'qa',
    'password': 'jPAd!XQCtn8Oc@2B',


sudo -l:

User qa may run the following commands on localhost:
    (dev : dev) /usr/bin/hg pull /home/dev/app-production/
